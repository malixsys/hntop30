This is because there can be impurities in the metal, and if you have a small part of a tooth that is harder than the rest it will erode the opposing gear (there is always some friction going on). By choosing the number of teeth to be relatively prime, the wear and tear is distributed uniformly on the gears, and thus they last longer.",

                "text": "Having been down this road, yes, it does take time, but you can save some time by using SVG and some DOM library. Although canvas is faster, most diagrams don&#x27;t really need it, so I use SVG unless I really need to switch to canvas. SVG also adjusts for screen dpi automatically.<p>The things I like:<p>1. Reactivity (ObservableHQ, Vue.js, hyperactiv.js, etc.). There&#x27;s usually some underlying data and then a corresponding visualization. These reactive systems let you modify the underlying data and then the visualization updates automatically. You don&#x27;t have to figure out which diagrams to update when. Even easier: just redraw everything every time you change anything.<p>2. Some easier way to write the DOM (d3.js, jsx, vue, lit-html, etc.). Since I&#x27;m writing a blog post with html, I usually prefer writing my js-in-html (vue) rather than html-in-js (jsx) but try both directions and see which you prefer.<p>3. No build step. This is especially important when I want to update a page years later and don&#x27;t want to figure out which build tools I was using in 1997 or 2007 or 2017. I want my pages to last for decades, and I still update my pages from 25 years ago.<p>I tried recreating one of the gear page diagrams in ObservableHQ <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@redblobgames&#x2F;unwind-circle-example\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@redblobgames&#x2F;unwind-circle-example</a> . It&#x27;s not a lot of code. There&#x27;s a slider, there&#x27;s a loop to generate the lines, and there&#x27;s the output svg. Whenever you move the slider it recalculates the output.<p>I admit that I&#x27;m not using ObservableHQ much for my own projects because I want more of a &quot;hand-written&quot; style. I used d3.js for my older pages and vue.js for my newer pages. Vue&#x27;s reactivity and templates save me probably a factor of 2 or 3 over d3.js.",

This probably would have been faster if I hadn&#x27;t been so out of practice with DHTML.<p>Another thing, though, is that some things are easier than other things.  Usually in a programming job you have to do the easy things and also the hard things.  This brings down the average.  If you&#x27;re writing a bunch of blog posts for fun, though, you can just publish the ones where good visualizations came out pretty quickly and discard the others that are much more effort for less return.<p>I feel like visualizations using d3.js are still pretty &quot;hand-written&quot;.",

Writing a blog post takes me around 10 hours, which is a fair amount of effort.<p>I believe that the visualizations will take more time than writing in general -- i.e. it would be more like 20 hours, bringing the total to 30.<p>If you consider that it&#x27;s 4K lines of code (assuming the base library is reused), it&#x27;s very easy to see that it could take 20+ hours.  Probably more like 40-80 to be honest.<p>I guess there is that other thread that says people only write 10 lines of code a day, which would make it 400 hours ;)  I don&#x27;t think that applies here but it could be closer to 400 than 10 or 20.<p>----<p>I also wonder if you can save time by using a less &quot;hand-written&quot; style (e.g. d3.js, which seems to be on everyone&#x27;s wishlist to learn).<p>My inclination is also to go &quot;hand-written&quot; rather than using a bunch of JS libraries.

            "text": "Nope, the mass of the lever doesn&#x27;t play in to the torque that is applied at all. All that matters is that the force be transmitted via atom-to-atom motion. It&#x27;s the rigidity of the wrench that mediates that, not its mass.<p>Of course, to create rigid objects, practically speaking they need to be made of something that will have mass. So the rigidity and the mass are related in a very loose sense. In any case, from a Newtonian physics perspective, you&#x27;ll see none of those terms in there - neither a &quot;rigidity&quot; nor a mass. The torque is simply the length of the wrench multiplied by the magnitude of the force.<p>In a more detailed analysis, you might consider the flexure of the wrench by analyzing the stress and strain inside the wrench. That would no longer treat the wrench as a perfect idealized body that is completely rigid, but rather a body that can stretch based on the internal compressive or tensile forces that arise inside of it. Sometimes we don&#x27;t think of metals as being stretchy, but with enough force, they&#x27;re not so different from a rubber band.<p>With all that said, once you consider the _dynamics_ of the situation - how the forces applied give rise to motion - then mass does come into play. If you apply torque to a wheel, that will cause an angular acceleration proportional to the mass of the wheel. If you were using a wrench to spin a gear, then the mass of the gear decides how fast it will start to spin. Also, the mass of the wrench matters here, since presumably it will be spinning too: some of your effort has to go into angularly rotating the wrench. So it would have a &quot;parasitic&quot; effect on how fast you could get your gear spinning.",

Since the working distances are related by a ratio, the working forces are related by the reciprocal of that ratio.<p>You can find the lever and fulcrum ratio with simple geometry. The input and output lever segments are radii, and the travel is distance along two arcs. Since the arc length is directly proportional to radius, the ratio of lever radii translates directly to the same ratio of arc lengths, and the reciprocal ratio is the force multiplier.

We define the torque of 100 newtons at a lever distance of one meter as the product of 100 newtons and a meter, which we can call 100 newton-meters, which is equal to 1000 newtons at a lever distance of 0.1 meters.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t really answer the question, which becomes, why is torque defined in this way an interesting thing to think about?  And the answer is that if the lever is a rigid body free to rotate around a fulcrum, then 100 newtons at one meter in one direction will make it start to rotate, while 1000 newtons at 0.1 meters in the opposite direction will precisely cancel that &quot;moment&quot;, as we call it, and there will be no tendency to start rotating.  It&#x27;s about what forces are needed to cancel each other.<p>Well, but, why should that be?  Why does it take exactly 1000 newtons and not, say, 316.2 newtons?  And I don&#x27;t think I have a really good answer for that question.  In the case of an elastic solid body it falls out of Hooke&#x27;s law and the geometry of the situation, which you can reduce to two long, skinny triangles sharing a common side bisected by the fulcrum.  But it seems to be much more general than that.<p>&gt; <i>I had thought it was because there is more mass acting on the point of rotation (longer lever = more mass).</i><p>Nope.  You can try using a pair of scissors or a folding ladder as a lever, or pull in different directions on the end of a fixed-geometry lever.  The lever&#x27;s mass doesn&#x27;t change, but the leverage certainly does.",

If you try to inspect this page, the design and animation is hidden behind canvas and some (nicely written BTW) imperative javascript. It is hard to replicate, and hard to compose with other elements. The illustrations are completely white when disabling JS, which is less than ideal graceful degradation. Some people would argue that executing custom scripts should not be required to show animated graphics, even if it includes basic interactivity.<p>For comparison, visit this page² and try to &#x27;inspect&#x27; animated graphics. Observe the SVG element in DOM and see how it changes when you scroll. Just by spending few minutes exploring you could probably recreate them, or at least reuse them somewhere else. We still don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s driving the animation (also JS), so that could still be improved using SMIL, but there is obvious benefit for using SVG here.<p>Don&#x27;t take me wrong, it is really a nice article with very pleasant and clear animations. I&#x27;m merely speaking from perspective of open standards, and technology stack that provides good foundation for building complex illustrations.

You can quote me on that and call it a pre-order.<p>I don&#x27;t have market research to back it up, but I do hear more and more people basically saying they haven&#x27;t bought a new phone in years because they&#x27;re all too big. Do they not include people who wear women&#x27;s clothing in their market testing?",

You can keep your attention to the front of the room that way.<p>It&#x27;s true that you can keep your attention off the computer while touch typing, but my experience is that I&#x27;ll just zone into typing what I hear without processing it, and end up not internalizing anything as a result.

Different people have different needs.<p>I use paper a lot too, but the iPad strikes a great middle ground for supporting memory better, being able to search back through things, keeping everything organized and accessible across years worth of data, and giving me more free-form input than I have with a keyboard (for diagrams, graphs, tables, etc).<p>You also get great apps that support things you can&#x27;t realistically do with paper, like Procreate&#x27;s perspective assist tools. It&#x27;s like working at a full size drafting desk with a big straightedge packed into something that you can toss in a backpack.<p>Like computers, it has more potential for distractions than paper, but when I really want to focus on something I&#x27;ll just put it on airplane mode.",

The legal system is in place to deal with this, and that should be more than sufficient, and it&#x27;s important that is the system used to deal with the issue, because everyone has rights.  The legal system is designed to allow both parties to exercise their rights.  Cowboy boycotts by consumers are emotionally driven mobs.  That&#x27;s not justice.<p>Finally, we as a society used to believe in second chances.  Once someone commits an offense, usually they pay some price (maybe losing a job, going to jail, paying a fine etc) and then we give them a chance to participate in our society again.  They don&#x27;t always get all their previous privledges back.  If you commit a felony, you won&#x27;t be able to own a firearm for example.  But you do get a another chance to be productive.",

It was a little XM receiver that plugged into your PC and could be driven from there via client software. And the protocol for communicating with the device was pretty open, so hackers quickly put together really good native clients for Windows, OS X, Linux, etc. that were miles better than both XM&#x27;s default client and their Web player.<p>It only lasted for a couple years, though, because those same hackers eventually figured out a way for clients to just rip every song that passed through the XM-PCR into high-bitrate MP3 files on your hard drive. So what went from a neat, hackable little device quickly turned into a music pirate&#x27;s dream.<p>There was a gentleman&#x27;s agreement for a while between the developers of the major clients not to take advantage of this capability, as they all knew that if it ever got exploited at scale XM would shut down the PCR and all their work would instantly be rendered worthless. But inevitably someone shipped a client with this &quot;feature&quot;, and XM predictably stopped selling the PCR and remotely disabled all existing units. Boom, so ends a scene.<p>(Here&#x27;s a contemporary story from Ars Technica with more detail on the shutdown: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;uncategorized&#x2F;2004&#x2F;08&#x2F;4147-2&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;uncategorized&#x2F;2004&#x2F;08&#x2F;4147-2&#x2F;</a>)<p>It was all too bad, as like I said, if your use case was playing music while you worked the PCR was a really cool little device. I suppose this is why we can&#x27;t have nice things :-&#x2F;",

            "text": "I received a trial of Sirius when I bought my vehicle. My Dad bought a life-time subscription (at a time they were practically giving them away) so I had listened to Sirius a few times when borrowing his car. My impression was they have bought and paid for a particular catalogue of music and they play that catalogue pretty exclusively. That catalogue seemed to have the 4th or 5th most popular songs from a huge list of artists but rarely the top 3. It is a massive catalogue but when you listen to it enough it starts to become repetitive and I would start to wonder &quot;do they even have any other songs by that artists&quot; after hearing a b-side for the third or fourth time.<p>I even considered buying it anyway since I like to go on trips to remote areas (fishing&#x2F;camping) and can&#x27;t rely on data for my phone for Spotify. In many rural places there is only a single radio station and even then it may be mostly static. But I found in those locations even Satellite reception was spotty, especially in the mountains or valleys I frequented.<p>Compared to top-40 FM radio, Sirius is amazing. It had its time. But comparing it to the internet with Youtube and Spotify (or Apple Music, etc.) just blows it away.",

These days I get more mileage out of Pandora and a few podcasts.<p>Also a fun little note - if you have a standalone radio with active service, then turn it off and stuff it in a box, cancel the service, and wait a few months or a year before pulling it back out, you&#x27;ll have free service for the life of the radio. They stop sending the device specific kill codes after a while so it will just keep working.",

That includes e.g. long running DJ mixes, not exactly the type of material for the official release bureaucracy and associated costs.<p>The only problem with SoundCloud is that instead of following the Spotify model, i.e. get listeners to pay for listening, they could have done it the other way around: get makers pay some nominal fee for hosting. Which they kind of did in the beginning but gradually drifted towards the listener-subscription model. As a paid music hosting service they&#x27;d at least provide an alternative for specific class of artists, i.e. those who make music for the love of it and want to be heard via unofficial channels.<p>SC failed to become one. They&#x27;ve had some back and forth and experimentation with pricing and subscription models over the years but never settled at anything targeted clearly and unambiguously. The current offerings are confusing and inconvenient for all classes of users. There&#x27;s now an all-time upload limit for non-paying makers, and ads for non-paying users. What&#x27;s the point of this? Getting both makers and listeners pay you? Sounds like a poor plan to me, that leads to nowehere.",

The same is very much NOT true of mental health problems.  Schisophrenics are diagnosed, almost always, when their condition manifests in such a way to interfere with their life (or someone else&#x27;s) to the extent that the doctors get called in.  There are widely assumed to be LOTS of undiagnosed mental health cases in society, simply because the sufferers live in situations where their disorder can be managed (or suppressed!) in an ad hoc way.<p>Now, the question becomes: are blind people more likely to be living in a circumstance where their mental health troubles are more easily managed&#x2F;ignored&#x2F;suppressed without the involvement of doctors who would otherwise diagnose schizophrenia?

Yes, that is the meaning that is being discussed.  You understood it yourself.  Grandparent understood it as well.  What value do you feel bringing up this point brings to the debate?<p>&gt;  like a weak magnetic field acting on a magnetized coin<p>Probably not.  The field will act through the other face of the coin as well.  The coin is pulled towards the magnetic surface, but it doesn&#x27;t alter the revolution of the coin.  If the field is sufficiently weak to not pass through the coin then it wouldn&#x27;t have any impact on the other side either.<p>The exception would possibly be mu metal or something else that prevents the magentic field from acting on one face entirely, in combination with a strong magnetic field, and I&#x27;m still going to lean towards &quot;probably wouldn&#x27;t work&quot;.  It would still intermittently pull the entire coin towards the surface, it&#x27;s not clear that it would counter the rotation of the coin itself.<p>&gt;  even a one surfaced approach is possible if you make use of carvings on the surface of the coin to get a favorable result from air resistence<p>No, because air resistance is acting on both sides of the coin at once.  The air resistance is a constant A+B, not A,B,A,B.<p>&gt;   lastly you can even achieve it through density<p>No, this is the entire point of the article.  The coin doesn&#x27;t revolve around its geometric center, it revolves around its center of gravity.  By changing the density of one side (balsa wood and lead, as I said) you change the center of gravity but the coin itself has the same rate of revolution.",

This can be well approximated¹ by a normal distribution with mean <i>μ</i> = <i>np</i> = 622 and standard deviation <i>σ</i> = Sqrt[<i>np</i>(1 - <i>p</i>)] = 25.<p>99.7% of the time², when you sample from this distribution, the sampled value will be within 3 standard deviations of the mean, i.e., between <i>μ</i> - 3<i>σ</i> = 547 and <i>μ</i> + 3<i>σ</i> = 697. Results further from the mean are more unlikely. For example, seeing a value more than 7 standard deviations from the mean (i.e., less than 447 or more than 797) is about a 1 in 2 trillion event³. Since 0 is about 25 standard deviations from the mean, the probability of seeing 0 heads is on the order of 10⁻¹³⁸.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2021801&#x2F;conditions-needed-to-approximate-a-binomial-distribution-using-a-normal-distribu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2021801&#x2F;conditions-...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;68–95–99.7_rule\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;68–95–99.7_rule</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.johndcook.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;table-of-normal-tail-probabilities&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.johndcook.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;table-of-normal-tail-probabil...</a>",

Although this is a low prevalence rate, it is higher than the rates for childhood-onset schizophrenia (Remschmidt and Theisen, 2005), and many other well-known medical conditions (e.g., Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, Prader Willi syndrome, Rett&#x27;s Syndome). Based on this estimated prevalence rate, in the United States alone (with a population of 311, 591, 917, as of July 2011, according the US census), there should be approximately 620 congenitally blind people with schizophrenia.</i> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3615184&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3615184&#x2F;</a><p>That does do rule out misdiagnosis etc, but it does seem to support a correlation.",

(Schizophrenic people deeply believe that they see how to &quot;connect the dots&quot; — hence a particular tendency for tinfoil hatism and other paranoid world views.)<p>It also seems to work with music and other sensory inputs, though, but as you said, it could be that the visual is beyond some threshold, or of a particular nature so as to be able to trigger the schizophrenic patterns.<p>There&#x27;s also this history of violence with the onset of schizophrenia, it seems to be an acquired condition notably highly correlated with childhood suffering (of abnormal magnitude and length), but with possibly typical genetic or epigenetic predispositions. This tells us again to search for a trigger, and it&#x27;s interesting that people born blind never seem to experience such a triggering, the onset of schizophrenia, ever.<p>But people born blind are also different in many other ways, biologically — notably circadian rythms, etc. I should know because although I&#x27;m perfectly able to see I experience a few but too many of the same kind of second- and third-order conditions that blind people have, and that led me to suspect it was related to a deficiency of mine in regions of the brain related to the processing of light in relation to time (cycles of melatonin, hunger, etc; iirc it&#x27;s generally involving the thalamus).<p>I don&#x27;t really know what conclusion to make of all this, but I feel these are clues, help narrow or focus the solution space.",

Let&#x27;s look at an example of a group that suffers disproportionately:<p>&#x27;The high level of schizophrenia in black Caribbeans living in the UK probably reflects the interaction of multiple risk factors, many of which cluster in the black Caribbean community in the UK. Particularly significant factors appear to be the combination of isolation and exclusion, both within society (living in areas of low ethnic density and reduced participation in society) and within the family (family break-up and paternal separation). These factors seem to be more powerful than socioeconomic disadvantage, which is more likely to be a consequence than causal. Racism itself may contribute to social exclusion, increasing the vulnerability to schizophrenia. Biological or genetic susceptibility do not appear to explain high rates of schizophrenia in black Caribbeans. More research is needed about the role of cannabis, particularly in its more potent forms, and whether this contributes to the excess of schizophrenia in black Caribbeans.&#x27;<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s as simple as: people that are born blind are to some extent insulated from risk factors that are conducive of schizophrenia.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2418996&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2418996&#x2F;</a>\n(just the first article I could pull up on a phenomenon I was aware of)",

Maybe someone should run a study on this?<p>A common post among the people over at &#x2F;r&#x2F;schizophrenia is that the so called negative symptoms of schizophrenia (anhedonia, apathy, reduced social drive, cognitive impairment, etc) are just as bad if not worse than the positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions). Unfortunately the negative symptoms are not adequately treated by any medicine and are in fact made worse (!) by medication. This is probably the number one reason why schizophrenics quit their medication - the medications are simply so shitty that people would rather risk the positive symptoms than experience worse negative symptoms.<p>There&#x27;s no good research directions for new schizophrenia medications either. Schizophrenia research certainly isn&#x27;t discussed (or have funds raised for it) as much as Alzheimer&#x27;s research despite the fact that 3.5 million people in the US have it, and it affects people at a much younger age.<p>Edit: Before starting medication I noticed some visual disturbances related to schizophrenia often known as sensory gating deficits. I would get an overload of visual sensory information to the point where I would notice nearly every detail in my visual range simultaneously (that&#x27;s the best way I can explain it). At times it was actually quite beautiful since the whole world would pop out in vivid color. However as soon as motion was introduced it quickly became overwhelming.",

For me, actual sight is associated with some physical feelings - not only do I see objects&#x2F;colors&#x2F;etc but there&#x27;s some degree of feedback from the muscles of my eye, best demonstrated by looking at bright lights vs dim surfaces. It&#x27;s very, very clear when I&#x27;m actually seeing something.<p>Then, separately from ocular perception, there&#x27;s an ethereal space inside my head where I can conjure up various &quot;platonic ideals&quot; of things, and the senses they generate. It&#x27;s like a sandbox of sorts, or perhaps that loading scene in the matrix where Neo and Trinity grab a bunch of guns.<p>By platonic ideal, i mean that when I think &quot;Apple&quot;, I sort of see an apple in that internal space, but it&#x27;s neither red, nor green - unless I focus on &quot;red apples&quot; in which case it will no longer be green, but also won&#x27;t yet be specifically a Fuji apple or a Red Delicious apple. It&#x27;s just an uninstantiated class of &quot;apple.red&quot; existing in my headspace.<p>No matter how hard I visualize the apple, no matter how many specifics I give it (Fuji apple, small soft brown spot on one side, with broad color splotches rather than narrow bands)...it never activates the &quot;feeling&quot; of real sight. It very much feels like it doesn&#x27;t exist, a temporary cloud of vapor that just &quot;poofs&quot; away instantly if it&#x27;s not constantly regenerated.<p>For me, there&#x27;s very little way I could see getting confused between my visual imaginations and my visual sight.<p>Generally when I conjure something up I don&#x27;t just see it visually, potentially I also sort of taste or smell or can recognize the feel of its texture, and maybe hear associated sounds like the breaking open sound of the apple. Again, all of these are extremely non-tangible and generally would never be confused with real sensations. They occupy a different space.<p>It&#x27;s like a simulation and modeling environment with a physics engine, more than anything else. It&#x27;s a place to run experiments - with or without hypotheses.<p>Also, almost all my thoughts have a verbal monologue. There aren&#x27;t &quot;characters&quot; in my head talking to me, it&#x27;s usually my own voice, but sometimes I can use other people&#x27;s voices to sound things out as well. Rather different from my internal monologue I can also pull up &quot;recordings&quot; of what other people said to me (which are really generative models, akin to a decoder in machine learning).",

Basically it seems that unless you&#x27;re 0&#x27;s across the board, you can form some part of some image in your mind, and thus don&#x27;t meet their definition.<p>Then again, the only one I rated above a 1 was &quot;gait&quot;, and that&#x27;s as much auditory as visual, so I&#x27;m not sure I believe them.<p>I took another online test which asked me to look at a 3D shape made of blocks, and then later compare others (drawn from different angles) and determine which was the same, without referencing the original.  It was an easy test, but to me it had little to do with visual imagery.  I just remembered the original shape as sounds (far easier than remembering a shape!), and then picked which of the others sounded the same.<p>That&#x27;s the fundamental problem I see with tests that try to figure out how a person thinks.  You try to invent a test which you believe can only possibly be solved in one way -- but people who don&#x27;t think that way already have a lifetime of experience living and thinking, so surely they&#x27;ve developed other mechanisms by now.<p>It&#x27;s like saying &quot;I know how to test if someone has two legs: we&#x27;ll put the finish line 100 meters over there!

I think &quot;aphantasia&quot; is all wrong.  It implies visual thinking is normal, and &quot;non-visual&quot; is the only alternative.

I felt extremely depersonalized for weeks and months after, concurrently I developed a swirling blind spot in my right eye.<p>A distortion, so to speak.<p>I saw neurologists and was diagnosed as having an &quot;ocular migraine&quot; however I never had a headache so this didn&#x27;t add up.<p>Looking back, I believe I was on the brink of becoming schizophrenic - and would have unless what happened next did.<p>So this next part is slightly controversial -- but hear me out<p>Through the several months that would follow I would discover and get obsessed with &quot;RSD&quot; -- a controversial company that teaches guys how to pick up girls.<p>On the surface, it sounds crass and not politically correct, but if you watch their videos &quot;get you in the door&quot; with &quot;game&quot;, and teach you topics of incredible value, like &quot;growth mindset&quot;, &quot;the power of now&quot; &#x2F; meditation and believing in abundance.<p>Now WTF does this have to do with the topic at hand?<p>Well, being receptive to these new ideas and absorbing them completely changed my world view.<p>I grew up in an extremely liberal household, and did feel any agency to affect the world around me. Fixed mind set.<p>What these guys gave me was empowerment, agency, a more conservative mindset under which the world &quot;made sense&quot; - there was now a framework for reality, rather than chaos.<p>Subsequently, I was able to learn programming from scratch, start a business, go on to make 6 figures less than a year later.<p>Somewhere along the line the distortion and negative feeling were entirely replaced.

We dare not even turn on IE or any other browser, we can&#x27;t even keep the tests green in Firefox.  Really wish we&#x27;d used cypress instead as its 100x easier to debug and we&#x27;re not getting cross-browser benefits anyways.<p>The underlying architecture is a bad design for heavy javascript apps in my opinion.  The roundtrips between the test runner talking to selenium server talking to selenium driver in a browser and back the other way is slow and so much can change on the page in between steps in your tests.  Cypress runs your test code in the javascript process of your browser so I believe theres no or minimal roundtrip lag.<p>We use `waitFor()` for the UI to stabilize but thats been a hard mental model for devs to follow and as a result we have tons of unnecessary waits in the tests which slows them down.  Even things like waiting for a loading modal to disappear before trying to interact with the UI is hard since your code:<p>`waitFor(&#x27;.loading-modal&#x27;, false) &#x2F;&#x2F; wait for it NOT to exist`<p>may run BEFORE its even appeared, then fail in the next step when you try clicking on a button and the modal is there now.  You can&#x27;t wait for it to appear first to prevent that, as your code may run after its already come and gone too.<p>Tons of annoyances or strange behavior like chromedriver doesn&#x27;t support emojis in inputs, ieDriver had select boxes set value broken at one point, setValue(&#x27;123&#x27;) on a field actually does something like &#x27;focus, clear, blur, APPEND 123&#x27; so blur logic to set a default value of &#x27;0&#x27; on your field will result in the final value being &#x27;0123&#x27; in your tests… just the worst.",

Of them, almost 70% in Hubei. Only 1% of cases have been registered outside China, in 24 countries (including Spain), with transmission chains (secondary cases from a first imported case) very short so far.<p>To put things in perspective, although perhaps inaccurate, the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in China is less than 3 cases &#x2F; 100,000 inhabitants.<p>The flu, in Catalonia, this week has reached figures of 360 cases &#x2F; 100,000 inhabitants: more than 120 times higher than the incidence of COVID-19 infection in China.[1]<p>Our Health Alerts and Emergencies system works, works as a team and the protocols established in the EU apply: detect the case, isolate it, treat it and follow all possible contacts. In this way, the transmission chain can likely be properly controlled.<p>There are many things we do not know for sure about this disease, but most cases (80%) are mild. Serious cases and mortality (2%) will be adjusted downwards safely in the coming weeks, as the detection of mild cases increases. There is WHO data that indicate that control measures are slowing the epidemic in Hubei and better controlling the situation in the rest of China.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canalsalut.gencat.cat&#x2F;web&#x2F;.content&#x2F;_Professionals&#x2F;Vigilancia_epidemiologica&#x2F;documents&#x2F;arxius&#x2F;spfi.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canalsalut.gencat.cat&#x2F;web&#x2F;.content&#x2F;_Professionals&#x2F;Vig...</a>",

We certainly have done that before with smaller launches. Our experience (anecdotally, I haven&#x27;t measured exactly) is that while &quot;playground&quot; type experiences can sometimes increase signup volume, they tend to result in <i>lower</i> engagement rates overall.<p>I believe the basic underlying hypothesis is that if you can solve a problem somebody is having and they know that, they don&#x27;t care how it works: they&#x27;ll sign up and figure it out. However, if you provide a playground, you artificially select for a much higher proportion of folks who enjoy the novelty of new technology &#x2F; products and aren&#x27;t necessarily likely to stick around.<p>Food for thought, anyway.

This despite the co2 service (presumably) being developed and published with autocode as well. The pervasive auto-complete and composability make the offering really compelling, but it&#x27;s unfortunate that (at least in that example) the two don&#x27;t work together.<p>On a related note it would be lovely to use (or allow) typescript and publish TS declaration files and thin generated clients for APIs deployed on autocode.<p>These are both minor nits in an otherwise impressive offering. Both are likely &quot;next iteration&quot; features since it seems like you&#x27;ve already solved a lot of the hard problems and these would be connecting existing dots together.",

        "text": "Hey all,<p>Keith here, founder and CEO of Standard Library (we made this &lt;3). The problem we&#x27;re focused on solving is simply -- building modern integration software is too difficult. (1) For professional engineers, it&#x27;s mundane work nobody wants to do and (2) for non-developers, best-in-class integration tools that rely on visual workflows just don&#x27;t cut sophisticated use cases for modern businesses, they often need some code.<p>Autocode solves these problems by providing an IDE that professional engineers can use to ship simple integrations in minutes and new (or &quot;low code&quot;) devs can use to automatically generate API integration code without needing to know much to start with. We provide a ton of features: an API registry, API autocomplete, code generation, serverless hosting for your APIs, an in-browser execution engine for your workflows, observability + logging, complete revision history. It&#x27;s kinda like Heroku and Zapier had a really, really ambitious child.<p>We&#x27;ve been at this, somewhat quietly, for four years and Autocode is what we&#x27;re the most proud of to date. We&#x27;ve been very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with some of the best companies in the industry to support our vision -- Slack and Stripe have been investors since (nearly) day one. That said, we&#x27;re a small team -- just five people -- and we still have a hell of a lot of work ahead of us. We would love thoughts and feedback!<p>YouTube video here for anybody that wants to see the full demo:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ha3C0X3Vyi0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ha3C0X3Vyi0</a><p>Thanks so much! :)",

There are 10x as many <i>professional developers</i> as you building small, hacky transient code within enterprise cos and SMBs and 100x as many <i>tinkerers, creatives, admins, product managers and more</i> just slapping together Airtable and Zapier as fast as possible to automate their jobs.<p>Autocode isn&#x27;t designed for the top of the pyramid.

For process credentials, LKRG attempts to detect the exploit and take action before the kernel would grant the process access (such as open a file) based on the unauthorized credentials.</i>",

The cages would leave the receiver accessible even when locked in order to be able to receive calls, so we would use the hook to do pulse tone dialing; dialing a number with many zeroes was always a challenge since it required 10 rapid taps as part of a longer sequence, but I built up muscle memory.<p>The practice was colloquially named &#x27;tap-dialing&#x27; and it was handed down from generation to generation.

British-made exchange equipment was extensively used there, so no modification was needed to make 111 the emergency number.<p>The reverse dial was a result of the design of early Rotary exchanges built in Antwerp around 1921. Similar Rotary exchanges were installed in Oslo as well in 1914, and Oslo also used the reverse dial (but nowhere else in Norway).",

            "text": "Yes, the hobbyist boards tend to include features that make the low power modes difficult to get into.  For example, the nRF52 eval board datasheet mentions that they have to waste 20uA of power to provide a reset button.  Things like reverse-polarity protection diodes use power.  You want those in your hobbyist board, but you probably want the extra year of life on your CR2032 in production.<p>In other cases, the boards aim to be small instead of complete, so just use a simple LDO to power the device from USB.  This uses a ton of power even if the MCU is off, and that&#x27;s where the battery drain goes.  Designs for real products tend to use a DC-DC converter that can be tuned for the desired sleep state.<p>Finally, the software that hobbyists use is basically designed to be easy, not efficient.  You don&#x27;t write any MCU init code, it just turns all power-sucking peripherals on by default.  That way when you go to use them, they work!  Accessing MCU-specific features to save power tends to be difficult, because the hobbyist stuff is designed to support every MCU ever designed from decades-old AVR chips to the latest ARM cores.  If you&#x27;re willing to include a bunch of headers and hack around what they do for you, you likely break core things like &quot;read a GPIO pin&quot; or delay_ms().  All in all, it seems unlikely to me that anyone is going to buy an Adafruit board, program it with Arduino, and get a low power device.  I tried and failed.  Adafruit themselves recommend using an external device to turn the board on and off at a scheduled interval to save power.<p>(I made an interesting nRF52 clock &#x2F; temperature sensor with an e-ink display a few months ago.  Every minute, the RTC interrupts the MCU to wake up, refresh the display, and send the temperature&#x2F;humidity data out over BLE.  I used Arduino and ... never got the power usage down at all.  It lasted for A DAY with a 100mAh Li-ion battery, even with the radio disabled completely.  The voltage regulator just burns power while the MCU is asleep waiting for that minute interrupt.  As it happens, it is super jarring when the e-ink display refreshes itself every minute, so I ultimately abandoned the product.<p>Also somewhere in there I realized that using Arduino is a giant waste of time.  When you just write your own C code, all of the manufacturer&#x27;s documentation suddenly becomes applicable, you can use fancy things like an RTOS, and you even get code completion with clangd in your editor.  Every time someone mentions microcontrollers I get mad at myself for wasting so many years with hobbyist-grade tools that never worked right.  But I digress.)<p>An interesting exercise is comparing the nRF52 reference design (deep inside a ZIP file from here, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nordicsemi.com&#x2F;Software-and-Tools&#x2F;Development-Kits&#x2F;nRF52-DK&#x2F;Download#infotabs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nordicsemi.com&#x2F;Software-and-Tools&#x2F;Development-Ki...</a>) with something like Adafruit&#x27;s nRF52 dev board: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn-learn.adafruit.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;assets&#x2F;000&#x2F;052&#x2F;793&#x2F;original&#x2F;microcontrollers_revgsch.png?1523067417\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn-learn.adafruit.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;assets&#x2F;000&#x2F;052&#x2F;793&#x2F;ori...</a>  You will notice that Nordic&#x27;s dev kit has a very complicated power stage, with solder bridges to turn off creature comforts for better power efficiency.  Adafruit just has a random linear regulator on there.",

The expansion of accessible internet service provider connectivity since that time has rendered the practice more or less obsolete.<p>&gt;A similar technique was sometimes used to get the first call for prizes in radio &quot;call-in&quot; shows, thus leading to the adoption of random &quot;fifth caller,&quot; &quot;seventeenth caller&quot; etc. by radio stations to circumvent this practice.<p>&gt;The term &quot;demon dialing&quot; derives from the Demon Dialer product from Zoom Telephonics, Inc., a telephone device produced in the 1980s which repeatedly dialed busy telephone numbers under control of an extension phone.<p>&gt;&quot;Demon dialing&quot; was popularized by the movie WarGames, which demonstrates the hacking technique (the technique eventually evolves into a technique called &quot;phreaking&quot;). After giving the program an area code and 3 digit prefix, the program then serially dialed every phone number in that prefix in order, recording which phone numbers were answered by a computer modem. Soon after, most likely because it was popularized by the movie, serial dialing was outlawed. Hackers got around this by simply randomizing the order the program dialed all the numbers. Later the terms &quot;demon dialing&quot; and &quot;war dialing&quot; became synonymous.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zoomtel.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;datasheets&#x2F;dialers&#x2F;demon_dialer_instructions.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zoomtel.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;datasheets&#x2F;dialers&#x2F;demon_dia...</a>",

No signal metering lag, and my LED bargraph gives 10 increments of resolution instead of just 4.<p>* The ePaper display is bistatic, meaning it doesn&#x27;t take any energy to display a fixed message.<p>* When I want to change something about the phones behavior, I just do it.<p>* The power switch is an actual slide switch.

But I had my touch-tone-enabled friends touch-tone me MCI codes and phone numbers I wanted to call over the phone, and recorded them on a cassette tape recorder, which I could then play back, with the cassette player&#x27;s mic and speaker cable wired directly into the phone speaker and mic.<p>Finally there was one long distance service that used speech recognition to dial numbers! It would repeat groups of 3 or 4 digits you spoke, and ask you to verify they were correct with yes or no. If you said no, it would speak each digit back and ask you to verify it: Was the first number 7? ...<p>The most satisfying way I ever made a free phone call was at the expense of Bell Communications Research (who were up to their ears swimming in as much free phone service as they possibly could give away, so it didn&#x27;t hurt anyone -- and it was actually with their explicitly spoken consent), and was due to in-band signaling of billing authorization:<p>Peter Langston (working at Bellcore) created and wrote a classic 1985 Usenix paper about &quot;Eedie &amp; Eddie&quot;, whose phone number still rings a bell (in my head at least, since I called it so often):<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langston.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langston.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langston.com&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langston.com&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langston.com&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;2332.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langston.com&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;2332.pdf</a><p>&gt;(201) 644-2332 or Eedie &amp; Eddie on the Wire: An Experiment in Music Generation. Peter S Langston. Bell communications Research, Morristown, New Jersey.<p>&gt;ABSTRACT: At Bell Communications Research a set of programs running on loosely coupled Unix systems equipped with unusual peripherals forms a setting in which ideas about music may be &quot;aired&quot;. This paper describes the hardware and software components of a short automated music concert that is available through the public switched telephone network. Three methods of algorithmic music generation are described.<p>Eedie &amp; Eddie (And The Reggaebots) - Some Velvet Morning (Peter Langston)<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1l0Ko1GUiSo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1l0Ko1GUiSo</a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wfmu.org&#x2F;365&#x2F;2003&#x2F;169.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wfmu.org&#x2F;365&#x2F;2003&#x2F;169.shtml</a><p>&gt;At the time I was also running a telephone demo that you could call up to hear samples of music composed for you while-u-wait by the computers in my lab. Most people called the mono telephone number that gave you a monophonic mix of the stereo channels, but you could also call either the left or right channel, or both, one phone on each ear, to get stereo -- this was how I worked from home. The elaborate phone connections were from the telephone switch in Brian Redman&#x27;s lab.<p>&gt;When the call would come in, the computers in my lab would start composing the 6 or 7 pieces that were played in the demo, while a voice synthesizer in Brian&#x27;s lab (Eedie) would accept the call (we paid the long distance on a few collect calls from music researchers in other parts of the world) and introduce the demo, explaining what was going to happen, then the call would be switched over to my lab where another voice synthesizer (Eddie) would take over, introducing each piece as it was played.<p>&gt;The idea for Eddie&#x27;s voice came from the overly-happy shipboard computer in the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy radio serial. In the phone demo Eddie would say something like:<p>&gt;Hi! This is Eddie! Your computer music phone, FRIEND!<p>&gt;Oh BOY! You are rilly rilly going to like this music, I can TELL!<p>&gt;[pause]<p>&gt;First, I&#x27;ll just make sure that Peter&#x27;s computer is working, and then we can share-and-ENJOY!<p>&gt;This is pretty much the kind of thing that Douglas Adams&#x27; computer said, and he was named Eddie, so we used Eddie as an homage. Then, when we wanted the voice-synth that answers the phone in Brian&#x27;s lab to be female, we considered how, later in the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide, Zaphod Beeblebrox chooses a different personality module for the computer and gets a worried old lady&#x27;s voice -- &quot;This will all end in tears!&quot; but Adams never gives her a name, so I chose &quot;Edie&quot; as a feminized &quot;Eddie&quot;. Unfortunately, the DECtalk voice synthesizer we were using pronounced E-d-i-e just like E-d-d-i-e with a short E vowel &quot;eh&quot; at the start, so we had to spell her name E-e-d-i-e in order to get the long E initial vowel sound.<p>&gt;Anyway, the little chit-chat between Eedie and Eddie at the beginning of the recording of Some Velvet Morning is typical of the sillier moments in the phone demo introductions, and is included as an attempt to familiarize the listener with their strange accents.<p>When you called (201) 644-2332, the Dectalk speech synthesizer would answer, say &quot;Hi! This is Eddie! Your computer music phone, FRIEND!&quot;, wait a few seconds, then cheerfully and sincerely announce, &quot;Yes, operator. I will accept the charges.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DECtalk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DECtalk</a><p>LGR Oddware: $1,200 DECtalk PC Speech Synthesizer<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bPW2S4fZMJY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bPW2S4fZMJY</a><p>Then Eddie would launch into his greeting and introduction to the phone tree of cool demos, like singing songs, telling jokes, generating improvisational music with L-systems or Stochastic Binary Subdivision, playing games, reading news summaries and weather reports, etc.<p>But then some &quot;music researcher in other parts of the world&quot; realized that it was perfect for making operator assisted third party collect phone calls!<p>Did you ever trick the phone company into cheerfully accepting the charges of a third party phone call? You will!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operator_assistance\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operator_assistance</a><p>&gt;A third number call or third party call is an operator assisted telephone call that can be billed to the party other than the calling and called party. The operator calls the third number for the party to accept the charges before the call can proceed.<p>So you could just dial 0, tell the human operator that you want to call any number you wanted, and charge it to (201) 644-2332. Then they would call that Morristown, New Jersey number for authorization, Eddie would answer, the human would ask &quot;Will you accept the charges for a collect call from ... to ...?&quot;, Eddie would then cheerfully announce, &quot;Yes, operator, I will accept the charges!&quot;, and the human would say &quot;thank you&quot; and hang up on the loosely coupled network of Unix systems with unusual peripherals at Bell Labs, then connect you through for free to whoever in the world you wanted to talk with, for however long you want to talk, charging the call to Bellcore!<p>&quot;Share and enjoy!&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_wSBC5Dyds8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_wSBC5Dyds8</a>",

As far as I understand those explanations:<p>- Names are released at a trickle, meaning no one can buy all of them in one go.<p>- Names have to be constantly renewed (it&#x27;s not a buy-once-keep-forever scheme), and (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), you can&#x27;t buy 10 years out in advance.<p>- A large portion of the initial names are reserved for Open Source developers, under the assumption that squatting won&#x27;t be so much of a problem if they get first pick.<p>It&#x27;s still not clear to me how this solves resource scarcity.<p>- If names are released at a trickle, does this mean I might want to register a domain for a project and there literally won&#x27;t be any able available for me to choose from?<p>- If names have to be renewed on a year-by-year basis, is there any mechanism for archival? Won&#x27;t this be strictly worse for link rot?<p>- If names are released at a trickle, doesn&#x27;t this create an even greater incentive for both good and bad actors to grab them as soon as they become available?<p>I&#x27;m mildly interested in Handshake because based on very limited research it seems in general to be an improvement over what we have. I get that perfect is the enemy of the good, I would take almost any improvement over the existing system. But at the same time, I still just don&#x27;t understand how this helps solve the squatter problem -- every once and a while I ask and get an explanation, and then think about it for a while and end up having more questions.<p>My perspective is, we want everyone to be online. We want everyone to have their own blog, we want people to be able to create websites on impulse. And we want resilient, long-term links that can serve as permanent addresses for content. The idea of combating squatters is based on the assumption that domain names will continue to be a scarce resource. But you fundamentally <i>can&#x27;t</i> have domains be a limited resource that are difficult to hoard if you also want random&#x2F;poor elementary school kids to be able to buy them.<p>Handshake talks about solving Zooko&#x27;s triangle: human-meaningful, decentralized, or secure. But the way I originally heard Zooko&#x27;s triangle explained to me (which may have been wrong) was: human-meaningful, secure, high-availability. Am I correct in assuming that in the second version, Handshake is optimized for human-meaningful and secure at the expense of high-availability? That domains will continue to be a limited, scarce resource that are susceptible to hoarding by people with lots of money? Or are there other mechanisms here that I don&#x27;t understand?",

(DE, US) is a corporation doing fundamental research for\nnaming, caching, and certificate authorities. They are allocated 6,800,000 of the\ninitial token supply.<p>Namecoin is a decentralized naming blockchain. 10,200,000 of the initial supply\nwas allocated to leading current and prior Namecoin developers.<p>Verisign, Inc. (VA, US) is the registrar for .com and .net. They are allocated\n6,800,000 of the initial token supply. The .com and .net TLDs on Handshake will\nbe given to Verisign with a DNSSEC proof.<p>Keybase has been innovating in the naming and certificate authority space.\nKeybase, Inc.

Of course, I am not condoning this - talk to your lawyer before you knowingly attempt to buy a name -- just pointing out that it is possible.  From there, we could extrapolate various ways the legal system gets involved, or &quot;pretty complicated governance models&quot; attempt to protect The Company&#x27;s claims, or the holder&#x27;s privacy&#x2F;control.<p>So, to answer your question: Handshake is definitely less centralized than existing systems (no entity to send a takedown request to), but it&#x27;s also not clear if strictly incompatible with laws in most jurisdictions.<p>I don&#x27;t think anything of this kind has been done before - my intent is to provide a bit of context and spark further discussion, but I&#x27;m not qualified to do more than speculate on how the legal stuff may play out.<p>That said, for some jurisdictions, &quot;B)&quot; may very well happen.",

I think in practice it&#x27;s more complicated than that.<p>First - I tend to think an idea with clear similarities being tried before and failing is default a non-negative (sometimes good) sign: shows us what didn&#x27;t work, and deepens everyone&#x27;s understanding&#x2F;validation of the problem space.<p>I would also say that it&#x27;s more similar to Bitcoin than most people would think.  Looking at the software, I think it&#x27;s pretty cool that handshake&#x27;s first implementation is a fork of a bitcoin implementation that has seen production usage for years (bcoin), one important change is the addition of opcodes to support covenants, so that blinded vickery name auctions can be done fully on-chain.<p>Basically, Handshake can build on top of the security and reliability that Bitcoin-like systems have validated for us over the last few years: namely, UTXO systems, proof of work, user knowledge&#x2F;habits around self-custody.<p>I think Bitcoiners could consider looking at Handshake from this perspective: there is a lot of core technology, architecture decisions, and spirit that is similar.  Perhaps if you believe in the potential of public blockchains like many early Bitcoiners do, the solution might not be things like sidechains (which are mentioned as a potential scaling option in the design notes), but extending the core technology in a minimal, single-purpose way (to support auctions)?<p>Perhaps it is possible that Handshake goes down as one of the best examples of an ambitious new project actually &quot;using Bitcoin&quot; (albeit in a way most Bitcoiners would not immediately agree with) instead of creating &quot;yet another token&quot;?<p>----<p>p.s.

How do I transfer those to try this new scheme? How much actual dollars&#x2F;euros&#x2F;yen&#x2F;yuan&#x2F;... does it cost, not mystery blockchain-whatevers but predictable real money? Does this new scheme harm me?&quot;<p>Shouldn&#x27;t an experimental system in particular want regular tech people with personal domains trying it out? We&#x27;d probably be more willing to give it a whirl (with fallbacks) since it&#x27;s more for our own private use. But instead it&#x27;s all about trademark holders and the Alexa 100k and so on, which is important too but it seems like most such domain holders would be a lot more conservative. And I&#x27;ve had a growing suspicion that the last part of the question doesn&#x27;t get answered clearly because the answer is &quot;you may get screwed, we are ideologues who think that people should be able to take your domain if you&#x27;re not rich enough to defend it.&quot;<p>I mean, right now I don&#x27;t in fact see the current DNS system as <i>horrible</i>. Cloudflare and others are pretty reliable registrars and companies to deal with. A .com is about $8, .net and .org both about $10. A known amount of $200 or so and I&#x27;m set for 10 years, and I consider that a good thing. I&#x27;ve had my domains for nearly 20 years now, they&#x27;re core to my online identity and personal infrastructure. Same for most businesses, DNS sits at the center of everything. My concerns are about ICANN allowed price increases due to monopoly, and whether bad actors could somehow try to claim my domain and how I&#x27;d fight that as an individual. But I don&#x27;t see answers in the FAQ to how this would help answer those. My personal domains aren&#x27;t in Alexa top-whatever so it sounds like handshake will auction them off. There is a &quot;renewal fee&quot; after that but it&#x27;s handwave-y:<p>&gt;<i>Renewals for names are annual and cost a standard network fee</i><p>A standard network fee of <i>what</i>? $1? $10? $100? It can vary by thousands of percent at random like so many cryptocurrencies? How long is the renewal window? Can it be paid upfront? What happens if it gets missed? Is any of this <i>predictable</i>?<p>I simply don&#x27;t see any brass tacks implementation stuff here. It&#x27;s a bunch of high level hoohah about the evils of centralization without any acknowledgement of how centralization can be useful and efficient too and how they deal with that. The word &quot;federation&quot; does not appear at all, which is another important approach&#x2F;aspect.

Needless to say, there is no truth whatsoever to alternative &quot;truth&quot; that drama speculated.<p>Second, by the time Sima Yi commanded a large field army, Cao Cao had died for a long time. Sima Yi represented powerful large land-owners who would gain monopoly on official positions during Cao Pi&#x27;s reign, Cao Cao&#x27;s son. It is a recipe for weakening imperial authority and endangering emperors. Historians argue that Cao Cao passed up the chance to become emperor because he would not countenance such policy.<p>Third, that TV show is like so much of Chinese TV that is a wasteland. It is melodramatic, ludicrous, and laughably bad acting. I am sorry, but it is unwatchable, not just the show, even the trailer. Compare the stylized combat and bloodletting to the realism of &quot;Game of Throne&quot; (yes, I am ware of the irony of calling historical drama fake and fantasy real); there is no comparison. Nothing there is believable, much like every word out of CCP&#x27;s mouth. It is sad, really.",

One is the theoretical analysis like Sunzi Bingfa, Hanfeizi etc. The other examples of application in different contexts, given in form of stories. It&#x27;s impressive how much more you can understand and learn if you combine Sunzi Bingfa with Sanguo Yanyi for instance.<p>Also the story becomes more deep when you realize that there are story elements where they act like the character would coincidentally slip into a situation but actually was probably stupid on purpose to create a much better outcome for himself. My favorite example being when Caocao fails to kill Dong Zhuo who is laying in front of him sleeping. If you are a mass murderer like either of these two there is almost no chance to fail to assassinate someone laying in front of you sleeping. And yet Caocao did.<p>What happened due to this failure? The rebels took him in and started to listen to his ideas, when before they ignored him due to his low background. Also one of his biggest competitors, Wang Yun, who coincidentally is the owner of the knife used in the attempted murder.<p>What would have happened if he had successfully killed Dong Zhuo? Lu Bu probably would have killed him on the spot. Maybe he would go in history as a small hero but he would have never become emperor.",

        "text": "My understanding about the article, which makes it interesting to me, is that (according to TFA) a lot of what is generally understood about The Art of War as general strategic concerns applied in very large scales or long timeframes was actually way more <i>literal</i> than people think. Always according to TFA, when Sun Tzu recommends &quot;attacking allies&quot; he literally means attacking them on the battlefield, because they are more likely to flee -- <i>not</i> undermining alliances prior to a war, as many people understand it. Likewise, when he means &quot;attacking the enemy&#x27;s strategy&quot; he didn&#x27;t mean &quot;undermining the long term grand strategy of the enemy&quot; but actually &quot;acting to neutralize the immediate battlefield plan&quot; (as in &quot;if the enemy tries to lay a siege, provoke him into attacking&quot;). Here strategy means &quot;immediate battlefield plan&quot;, not &quot;long term nation-wide strategy&quot;.<p>Overall, always according to TFA, Sun Tzu&#x27;s Art of Way is <i>way more practical</i> and <i>literal</i>, and less &quot;hand-wavey overall strategy&quot; than generally understood. I think I actually like this because it more or less destroys its appropriation by self-help&#x2F;business gurus. After all, if Sun Tzu is literally talking about killing your enemies while they are crossing the river, it&#x27;s less useful as a metaphor for startups -- a welcome side-effect.",

In the words of a devoted student of military history, James Mattis:<p>“Ultimately, a real understanding of history means that we face NOTHING new under the sun. For all the “4th Generation of War” intellectuals running around today saying that the nature of war has fundamentally changed, the tactics are wholly new, etc, I must respectfully say. “Not really”. Alexander the Great would not be in the least bit perplexed by the enemy that we face right now in Iraq, and our leaders going into this fight do their troops a disservice by not studying (studying, vice just reading) the men who have gone before us.”",

When they build a Walmart and Home Depot and food court 10 miles away, people will drive there for cheaper stuff. If people live close enough to walk here, it may develop a small hardware store, some clothes shopping, and maybe a thrift store. If the people who live nearby have to get into their car anyway, it will be just a destination among many, not a livable place.<p>I think that is the criticism of this project: it is not good enough to become what they want you to think that it is.",

We were not talking about whether the population of families was significant “enough to support a large number of businesses.” I was replying to a post that suggested New York was an example of “a living, breathing, functional and healthy” urban community. By my reckoning, middle class households with kids are underrepresented by a factor of six in Manhattan. That’s is a hugely distorted demographic statistic that suggests New York City is inhospitable to families. Yes, 3% of Manhattan households is like tens of thousands of households. But it’s a small minority. “Almost none” isn’t all that hyperbolic.<p>Given that 85% of people will have kids at some point, I think that disqualifies New York City from being deemed “functional” and “healthy.” If we are looking for cues as to how to design urban environments, we should be looking at places that serve the needs of normal people.

For what it&#x27;s worth, that area is undergoing massive development and change.

This is in addition to the hundreds of other apartments&#x2F;condos being built within a 1&#x2F;2 mile radius of that location.<p>The township (West Whiteland) is very aware of the issues with walking paths and sidewalks to nearby areas and train stations, and there are active plans to address it.

            "text": "I first encountered this kind of shopping center in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Main Street at Exton struck me as incredibly strange - it&#x27;s a strip mall dressed up to look like an urban downtown, right down to parallel parking spots on the street. Once you do park, it is actually fairly walkable.<p>A couple of years later, after having moved to Philadelphia, there was something I wanted to grab at a store in Main Street at Exton. There&#x27;s a regional rail station a half mile from the shopping center, so I hopped a train. The absurd thing about this particular arrangement, which otherwise sounds like a great way to connect nearby markets, is that there is no sidewalk between the train station and the shopping center. The station sits where a major local road meets a major highway, so one way or another, you&#x27;re crossing six lanes of traffic to get past the local road, and you have to cross two major highway four-lane on&#x2F;off ramps as you go under the highway overpass, walking along a beaten grass path with only a curb between you and the  traffic.<p>Exton Mall&#x27;s another mile up the road, and while there&#x27;s sporadic sidewalks between the two malls, I&#x27;ve never bothered with that walk.<p>Given the proximity of this shopping center to public transit, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big leap to suggest that the decision to exclude sidewalks was at best a classist choice, at worst a racist choice.<p>I live in a part of Philadelphia that&#x27;s unusually pedestrian friendly, all things considered. I can walk to pick up groceries (except I get those delivered), the hardware store, coffee shops, restaurants, galleries, all manner of everyday things that, when I lived in the exurbs, I had to hop in the car and drive anywhere from 5-30 minutes to get to, and it&#x27;s fantastic. We&#x27;ve also got more methods of public transit than almost anywhere in the world (not saying the coverage is great, mind you), and I&#x27;ve been here long enough that despite all the challenges that come with living in an old urban center, I hope I never have to go back to a suburban lifestyle.<p>It was clear from the moment I pulled up to &quot;Main Street&quot; that these psuedo-downtowns miss the point.",

There&#x27;s no car traffic in the Grove, and no car traffic in the farmers market.<p>I&#x27;d also add in, this is different from a downtown in that is was planned. It wasn&#x27;t like they had constraints based on locations, public roads, etc. If we were talking like revitalizing an actual downtown (like Oregon District), I&#x27;d be a bit less critical. But when I see planned &quot;downtowns&quot; that make it so the pedestrian is still subservient to the car, and it doesn&#x27;t have all the amenities I actually need to live there (which I&#x27;ll give that I probably have to drive somewhere to work, but still, even something as basic as a grocery store), Sorry, not really interested.",

There is a bus running up and down, but the bus rarely seems to have much ridership.<p>The old core of S.Fe contains almost none of the basic essential retail outlets for day to day life. There are no supermarkets, no hardware stores, for example (Kaunes is about as close it gets). You see very few people walking around other than tourists. It is true that the Rail Yards is a moderately successful (re)development of a downtown area that was previously ... well, rail yards. But it hasn&#x27;t really done much to change the retail&#x2F;hang out situation other than adding an REI, a brewery and a movie theater. All good things (for me) but they don&#x27;t change the fact that living in S.Fe without a car will remind you constantly that you don&#x27;t have a car.<p>One great thing here are hundreds of speed bumps on residential streets.

Most people will live further out where affordability is more realistic. At least for me about &quot;half-way&quot; out from the center of London, getting to my local grocery store is a 33 minute walk, 27 minute bus (assuming I did not have to wait at the stop at all first), or just an 8 minute drive.<p>Note also that the bus would be a £3.40 return ticket, which is enough for about 2.5-3 litres of petrol. A toyota prius that can do about 3.7l&#x2F;100KM means that for the price of a bus ticket you could cover about 68KM (~42 miles) or for a tesla 3 that gets 240Wh&#x2F;mile charging @ £0.24&#x2F;khw you&#x27;d get about 95KM (~59 miles). For the case of this example where it is about a 5 mile round-trip, you&#x27;d be looking at 9 or 12 return trips to the grocery store depending on if you took the prius or the tesla, for the cost of a single round-trip on the bus.<p>It is doable without a car, but not easy. You get into a situation where you are trading off trying to carry 20+KG of shopping back on the (crowded) buses vs taking multiple separate trips a week (...and the £3.40 monetary cost + minimum 54 minute travel time cost). And it might be raining (not easy to hold an umbrella when you have 16 carrier bags you are trying to lug). With a car you can easy haul back many 10s of KGs of shopping in one trip, while staying dry, with just 16 minutes spent getting there and back ... and in a car you are guaranteed a seat too :)<p>Personally I did the trade off and found that having a car for day-to-day life is just so much easier (not just for shopping but for all sorts), but obviously I&#x27;d never drive into the centre of London (if nothing else, there is nowhere to park) and happily walk + get the tube when in the centre of town.

RTC predates the expansion of the subway system, so drive-to urbanism was, as you suggest, a reasonable option given other constraints.<p>Now that the Metro is (almost) expanded past Reston to the airport, there is (was?) an opportunity to build a true human-scale urban environment (at least within the designated development area, roughly between Sunrise and Sunset Rds and just east of Whiele to just west of RTC).<p>However, that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re seeing.  Developers are dropping absolutely massive buildings (several blocks square) with little in the way to pedestrian access.  The new complex on the north side of Weihle Station is NOT accessible by foot - you have to cross 8 lanes of traffic coming from the east, and if you &quot;win&quot; that game of Frogger, it&#x27;s not intuitive how to access the new complex - it&#x27;s a disjointed mess, at least visually.<p>The new development south of RTC (Halley Rise, where my office is located) isn&#x27;t any better.  The new Wegmans building doesn&#x27;t align with existing roads and is several blocks wide.  Getting from Halley Rise to RTC requires another game of Frogger across the Reston Parkway bridge (at which point, you have to cross the parking lots at Bechtel and Microsoft).<p>It&#x27;s really frustrating as a resident and worker in the area.

There&#x27;s no mix of building sizes&#x2F;uses - it&#x27;s just whatever the developer thinks will be most profitable today, with little regard for future evolution (short of tear down and rebuild the whole thing in 20 years).",

They even got it right with mostly underground parking giving the outdoor mall a high-level of walkability between stores that have fronts directly on the wide side walks.

What he misses is a few things:<p>a) Palo Alto can hold onto its  old town feel because it’s literally the epicenter of Facebook, google, sand hill road and Stanford university.  Some random town in Florida isn’t going to have all that.<p>B) in places like Florida, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Houston, etc, it’s simply not feasible to constrain parking when a good part of the year no one wants to walk a half mile or more to get groceries.<p>There are other ways for places to be nice and not look like an early 1900s town center... I’d submit Austin as an example:  it’s totally car centered but has lots of intriguing and distinct neighborhoods and plenty of variety while also being quite suburban and housing quite a lot of strip mall retail.<p>The small downtown can also be very restrictive and expensive for lower income families.  For example, in New Jersey, and eastern PA there are quite a few quaint little towns.  Oh sure their town centers are full of small restaurants and dog grooming, pharmacies and banks, but conspicuously absent are grocery stores.  I know of whole towns with 10-40k residents and not one grocery store.  It’s worse in places like Chicago where lack of access to quality fresh produce has been linked to higher rates of crime.<p>These small towns create high rates of NIMBY-ism and while they do retain their turn of the century charm, I would suggest that it’s just as Hollywood as the new urbanism but in different ways.<p>I think we can all agree strip malls probably weren’t the best invention and new urbanism isn’t perfect but at least developers are trying to do something appealing rather than just put up another crappy building with nail salons and vape shops.",

By that metric, almost all of Manhattan is <i>extremely</i> walkable.<p>Manhattan does have many isolated &quot;deserts&quot; where you can find yourself surrounded by just residential buildings (parts of UWS and UES, for example), or a heavy concentration of businesses, parking, industry (e.g. 11th-12th Ave around Hudson Yards, for example). Until a decade ago or so, the Finance District used to be pretty dead at night. And so on.<p>There&#x27;s fairly low &quot;pain threshold&quot; in the US before people discard walking as an alternative and just go in their car. We all know the satiric image of the American who jumps in their car to go one block; in my experience (as a European living in the US), there&#x27;s a certain amount of cultural indoctrination that has persuaded Americans that transportation by car is absolutely necessary.",

Almost the entire population has at least a kei car, unless you work in a snack bar&#x2F;kabakura (where transportation is often provided, and your job involves getting shit-faced drunk every night so you can&#x27;t drive home anyway).<p>American Village is also my least-favorite place to go on the island: the traffic to get into that area is abysmal, especially after 4pm, and during the summer the brutal heat, sunlight, and humidity makes walking around between the buildings unappealing. Ashibina Outlet Mall is similar, but at least has slightly better overhead cover to protect from the sun.",

We installed pricey home theaters and distributed audio for the rich suburban folks.<p>I remember several &quot;planned communities&quot; where they had small strip malls on the outside of the community, and then it was all high end craftsman and cape cod style houses on the interior. They had removed as many streets into the main center of the community as possible. In order to get to two of the houses we were working on, we had to park several hundred yards away and walk in to the houses.<p>Sure, it was awesome for the kids as they could go about their business without fear of high speed traffic, but it was a royal pain to heft in all the wiring boxes, tools and other stuff we needed to do our job. I also noticed, all the houses were reduced to two car garages. When I started talking to one of the owners, he gave me a litany of things they had to agree to before being able to build their homes. The strict building codes forbid three level houses, more than a two car garage, and each lot had to leave a strict percentage of &quot;green&quot; space - aka grass on each lot, and you were required to have a porch (you know, to encourage &quot;community&quot; and bonding with your neighbors) which also had a bunch of requirements you had to meet. There were other ones, but those were the ones which always stood out to me.<p>In short, they were trying to create some kind of a movie like community in every sense.",

At least the work to support the product should be tracked and valued.  And for all the work that you and the freelancer are doing, you should be splitting it into COGS vs. R&amp;D.<p>The problem comes if you&#x27;re doing a bunch of support work that you&#x27;re not accounting for. Then you go to sell the business and it turns out that it takes a whole FTE to support the product.  You&#x27;re talking about $300k&#x2F;year in unaccounted costs that you&#x27;d need to account for if you were to ever stop doing all the support (either because you become full-time CEO or you sell the business).<p>It&#x27;s also easy to fool yourself into thinking you have a real business if you don&#x27;t account for your own time.  It&#x27;s easy to just create a job for yourself and not actually create a business.<p>&gt; <i>Would a list&#x2F;graph of recurring costs be sufficient?</i><p>Yeah, I think you need to take all your costs and all your revenue and bucket them as one-time vs. recurring (or COGS vs. R&amp;D, whatever you want to call it).

Not sure if I would consider it as essential though, because I can always take over and do it all myself. But I&#x27;m not planning to do it all myself.<p>Freelancer costs will not scale as much as traffic would scale. As the work of the freelancer is related to new features. Most of our systems can handle a lot of traffic and if we can&#x27;t anymore we need to add more hardware (which will be recurring) or write some software (which is not recurring).<p>As for recurring gross margin.

Otherwise if you spend $4k on a marketing site it looks like your business is suddenly doing terribly.  If you don&#x27;t want to throw out R&amp;D costs completely then at least amortize the R&amp;D costs.",

Personally speaking, there are a few reasons I&#x27;ve switched from Google Analytics:<p>1. The simpler UI is much easier to explain to clients. No training needed.<p>2. The simpler UI also helps me keep track of my _own_ metrics faster – I can do a 1 minute check at the end of the week instead of clicking through layers of dashboards and setting up custom reports.<p>3. Now I don&#x27;t need to show an annoying cookie popup across all of my sites; I also like that it respects my users&#x27; privacy.<p>4. My sites load a bit faster (GA had a larger filesize). This is supposed to help with conversion.<p>5. Having support, if I need it, is nice. Going with a smaller company is almost an _easier_ sell to my clients because they know they have the option to get help when they need it.<p>Also, it doesn&#x27;t matter to everyone, but I like to support indie businesses when I can. Analytics are important, but they&#x27;re not mission-critical (like payment processing or something), so I&#x27;m fine with working with a smaller company in this area.<p>Congrats OP!",

We got a lot of great feedback for applicants who didn&#x27;t got selected because of this.<p>Although we are still in the starting phase (he started in January) I&#x27;m very happy with the output our developer Dave produces.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SimpleAnalytic&#x2F;status&#x2F;1191341896037289984\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SimpleAnalytic&#x2F;status&#x2F;119134189603728998...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hellodeibu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hellodeibu</a>",

The other side of the coin is that the habitat for wolves is from sea level to approximately 9800&#x27; (3000m). They hunt wherever they can find herbivores. One part of ranching people don&#x27;t seem to understand is that the rancher (by rancher I mean whoever is working on the ranch) is caring for living animals. That means he is looking out for these animals on a daily basis. I know their are ranchers who don&#x27;t get attached to their stock, but they are definitely the minority. It&#x27;s hard to care for anything daily and not get attached. I&#x27;ve seen ranchers in tears over the loss of a single cow, because they&#x27;ve cared for that cow since it was born. From time to time I would take a steer to slaughter so that we had meat in the freezer. The last thing I would do after unloading the steer would be to thank him for giving his life to feed my family. When a pack of coyotes take a calf, it is heart breaking to see the reaction of the mama cow. My neighbor last spring came upon a cow that was struggling to give birth and she was down. The coyotes had killed the calf and were eating it even though it was only part of the way out of the cow. Do you think that might have upset him a little? Now they want to release a much larger predator onto the land he is trying to care for. How do you think that makes him feel? There is more to caring for livestock than money.<p>You could work in Commerce City and be smelling the hydrocarbons all day, and maybe even getting cancer.",

        "text": "As someone who grew up in a wolf reintro zone I have a few comments and opinions to help others have more productive conversations.<p>First, not all wolf reintro&#x27;s are the same. Each ecosystem is different and the scientific justifications need to be done for each, and the papers for one do not necessarily apply to the other. The Yellowstone program may have been a success, but other places are not Yellowstone, and it is a mistake to use it as a way to handwave away criticisms. Also, sometimes the justifications are pretty weak, and could easily be made up with by increase in hunting tags or adjustment of hunting time windows and area restrictions.<p>Second, there are jurisdictional and public control issues at the heart of the matter. There are people who actually have to live in these areas and they are major changes. I strongly dislike the attitude of some that locals should have no say. The people in our area voted against the reintro program and it was done anyway, with the governor saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care what the people want, the reintro program is happening&quot;. That is a problem. I have also seen the effects of fresh Forest Department&#x2F;BLM phd types ignore the locals wisdom and advice and pay the price for it, and the same &quot;We know better than you back country bumpkin&quot; condescension tends to be at play in the reintro programs. These things have real consequences. For example, as a kid my grampa who was a logger in the area in the 70&#x27;s and many other loggers were saying the Forest Service needed to let the loggers thin the forests out and to do more control burns. I being young thought the old loggers were just old-fashioned and the PhD&#x27;s knew what they were doing, until reality happened. The holier than though attitude of the credentialed people prevailed, then the pine beetle infestation hit, and within a decade we had two ~500,000 acre forest fires that the forests are still recovering from.<p>Third, there are often claims that wolves never attack humans, and those claims are blatantly false or are using very carefully selected statistics (North America only, etc) to craft a narrative. Beyond that, it vastly changes the safety profile of being in the forests, in a way that discourages people from experiencing it. Many locals from my area have posited that this is an intentional side-effect. Even more so when the rumors of a grizzly reintro program started floating around (I don&#x27;t know if these are just rumors, but who can blame the locals for being afraid of an unelected unaccountable bureaucracy who already ignores them from doing something else against their wishes). We used to be able to only have to worry about bears or mountain lions, who both have pretty easily avoided confrontational profiles, but now locals don&#x27;t go anywhere without being armed.<p>Fourth, the dismissal of the cattle ranchers is far overrated. Cattle ranching, especially in this day in age, is a science in itself, and in the forest is a vital part of forest maintenance. Silviopasture&#x2F;agroforestry is also often studied by the kids of the old ranchers who then come back and apply that knowledge. Thoughts of the ranchers as dumb hicks is a foolish and insulting stereotype. Not only that, but often the forest service and BLM are underfunded and undermanned, and many of the ranchers who are paying public land leases do a good job assisting in maintaining the forest, and unlike the new kid who just got shipped in from across the country after getting a degree, they live there and have passed down local knowledge for decades if not longer.<p>I know it&#x27;s easy to see something like a wolf reintro program and assume it&#x27;s a great thing and just jump on the bandwagon, but maybe a perspective from someone who grew up in one and have heard out the locals on the issues might help color your view on the topic a bit.<p>Otherwise you just end up with a bunch of locals that around the campfire say &quot;It&#x27;s all about the three S&#x27;s... shoot, shovel, and shhhhh&quot;.",

Democracy should be informed by the technocrats, not replaced by technocracy. In this case, I think voters should be listening to ecologists to understand the effects that reintroduction of wolves will have, but it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s still up to the voters to decide whether to prioritize restoring the ecosystem versus making life easier for those in the agriculture industry.",

They are <i>not</i> a good sole party to address the economics, social&#x2F;cultural&#x2F;community issues, or a number of other aspects of programs like this.<p>Wolf reintroduction is major change with the potential for disproportionate impact on a small group of people (or at least there&#x27;s a huge fear of it), and combined with a very real sense that some outside elite authority is just autocratically dictating without listening there is great potential for it to go sideways. (Keep in mind that centralized power structures dissipate with distance&#x2F;isolation - witness rural sheriffs refusing to enforce specific laws in some states, etc.)<p>In general there should be a second angle: how to support the community, make the program successful, and have buy-in. This means maybe there should be some combination of communication, support, insurance, or grants to mitigate community concerns, and that it should be treated as an ongoing back-and-forth that tries to balance concerns for long term success, not as a dictate to people who are ignored.",

The dogs stay put in defensive positions and defend the flock as a pack.  They&#x27;ll kill a wolf that gets too close, but they usually just chase them away.  They can&#x27;t chase too far or go out individually or they risk being killed by wolves.  They&#x27;re also more effective when the weather is such that they can use their sense of smell.<p>Edit: I posted this upthread, but apparently <i>guardian dog</i> is the term for dogs defend against predators (but they do not control its movement), <i>herding dogs</i> control the movement of a herd (but do not typically defend it well).<p>Edit this is interesting: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;cinco-deseos-ranch-livestock-guardian-dogs&#x2F;using-herding-and-guardian-dogs-together-simple-guidelines-to-build-a-great-team&#x2F;1261113647266913&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;cinco-deseos-ranch-livestock-...</a>",

Airplanes and elevators have nothing in common with code written by normal software companies.<p>They optimize for a compromise between short-term gain and long-term gain. In essence, a startup can mathematically proof its software and go bankrupt before they even reach a prototype stage. Or they can shell out utter crap quickly, get some early feedback, funding and beta testers and slowly figure out what to improve first for the biggest bang.<p>Same goes for giants, like Google. They technically have the resources to prove SOME projects and they DO. For instance, Amazon proves their hardware virtualization software and other core pieces, where bugs would undermine the safety of the entire cloud.<p>I am getting a bit sick of &quot;Why is software engineering so bad compared to XYZ&quot;. All the people asking are either not in this field or are junior engineers who just don&#x27;t yet understand why things are the way they are and why writing bug-free, mathematically proven software is infeasible, unnecessary, impractical, undesired, etc.<p>Consider another analogy. When building a house, how expensive is it to decide that you actually want to have a ceiling with 5 meters high in the second floor, because the buyer of that floor wants higher ceilings? Simple: Tear down the building and start over...<p>In software? Usually it comes down to adding an IF-statement or some such. Software follows completely different economic principles and serves completely different needs.<p>There is at least one dimension though where this problem currently shines through: Self-Driving Cars.<p>I think auto-pilots in self-driving cars SHOULD follow the same rigor as airplane auto-pilots and they are most certainly not doing that, which will and already has resulted in lost lives.",

I say this as an ops type who has seen stack complexity as one of the main barriers to reliability. The reasons for this being <i>the standard</i> are numerous and understandable though.<p>It&#x27;s essentially the main weakness of the open source ecosystems too. The many eyes theory falls apart when the LoC reach many millions. There will never be enough eyes finding bugs or poor practices. Maybe in the future machine learning could help reduce this gap.",

I deferred it until a future post because I think that we accept that we don&#x27;t fully understand the systems and stack because of our incentives. Imagine if the stakes were much higher: if our software was hooked up to pacemakers that stopped pumping blood when the software was down. This isn&#x27;t so crazy: people who design airliners go on the test flights. We would band together as an industry to produce guidelines and recommendations around safe ways to run sites. We&#x27;d quit rather than work on a doomed project for a paycheck. Any work would require something equivalent to expert certification and design validation at every layer of the stack. We&#x27;d do everything in our power to avoid creating these emergent systems. But the situation is reversed - in many circumstances, the cost of failure couldn&#x27;t be lower. We tolerate the fact that we don&#x27;t understand the emergent systems that we create because it doesn&#x27;t matter enough for us to care.<p>But I don&#x27;t want to make it sound like I&#x27;m dismissing you&#x27;re point. You&#x27;re right and it&#x27;s super important. I think there&#x27;s a better angle that I can use to explore this. It might be &quot;Why do so many websites get hacked and lose our personal data?&quot;, but I feel like that doesn&#x27;t fully capture it. I have to think about it. But this seems less relevant to the election case, which is what I wanted to address - that these projects fail because &quot;launch and iterate&quot; has become so ingrained in our process that it&#x27;s difficult to recognize when it doesn&#x27;t apply.",

HTML is the simplest, most stable, and most battle-tested client-side framework ever created, and it&#x27;s stateless and runs on all devices without even an installation step. Toss some CSS on there to make it look pretty; CSS is stateless too so it won&#x27;t introduce any real bugs. It doesn&#x27;t have to look perfect; you&#x27;re not marketing it to anyone. You&#x27;re just collecting input from users who don&#x27;t have a choice of product.<p>For the back-end use something dead-simple like PHP or NodeJS. The business logic can&#x27;t be that complicated; I assume it&#x27;s really a very simple CRUD app. Just accept form submissions, authenticate, validate, drop it in the database. Done.<p>Spin up a couple of hand-managed VMs on DigitalOcean or the like for hosting both the databases (probably just one database?) and the web servers. It&#x27;s not a small user load, but it&#x27;s much smaller than the typical internet company, and it only needs to run for a few hours. You don&#x27;t need automated scaling and restarting while you sleep. Sit a task force at their desks during the event to repair any outages as they happen.<p>Use the right tool for the job. Your stack should be exactly as complicated as the task demands, and no more.",

In short, many of them accuse the book of specific sins it did not commit.

Alice and Bob know each other, and are embedded in a community. They have access to a reasonable approximation of each other&#x27;s reputation. Alice knows whether or not Bob tends to default on his debts. Alice can make Bob pay for defaulting with his reputation, which can theoretically become so bad that nobody wants to trade with him, which in many historical circumstances may be a literal death sentence.

I would argue that money happens very quickly, which is why you’re not going to see a lot of evidence of extensive barter. If one childhood is enough to establish a candy currency, then you’d expect a similar currency to develop very quickly in any society.",

        "text": "It was a good article until the gift economy crap at the end. Game theory explains all of this quite well.<p>Money is desirable because it makes transactions and economic calculation so much easier. As a pure abstraction, money is simply a ledger (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minneapolisfed.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;sr&#x2F;sr218.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minneapolisfed.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;sr&#x2F;sr218.pdf</a>). When humans live in small groups related by blood, they just keep the ledger in their heads (if at all) because the penalty of cheating is so great that no one will defect (exile from the tribe and a lonely death).<p>When humans need to transact with people and there is uncertainty about (a) whether they will be able to punish cheating, and (b) whether they will ever meet this trading partner again, then they will use a more explicit and trustworthy form of money to reduce the risks. For most of human history the only real option here was some kind of physical token, which had to approximate the ledger abstraction: uniform in quality, easily divisible, easy to authenticate, with as inelastic a supply as possible.<p>The modern sovereign state allows for fiat money, since the state can simply declare that its official currency is the ledger that everyone will use. It&#x27;s quite efficient, since you can do things like maintain a banking system that exists primarily as numbers in a spreadsheet rather than vaults full of dusty gold bars. Our fractional reserve system also mingle debt and money, and for most of us the two are equivalent.<p>This makes perfect sense when you consider that money is a claim on the future output of everyone who agrees to use the money. It&#x27;s an EOU: everyone owes you. Thus, if you issue fiat currency against public debt, it&#x27;s effectively an EOU as well since everyone in the economy is indirectly responsible for the eventual repayment of that debt. Of course, sovereign currencies have borders, so looking at the ledger used by governments to keep score amongst themselves is quite telling.<p>However, when there is no socially accepted authority to dictate consensus, how do mutually disinterested individuals agree on a form of money? This was a pure thought experiment until the invention of Bitcoin, because the options were exceptionally limited: precious metals were so much better than anything else that had been tried, for reasons I won&#x27;t go into here, that there really wasn&#x27;t a choice. But with Bitcoin, you have a protocol for digital cash that can be used to create an infinite number of ledgers with the same desirable properties. How do we choose which one to use?<p>The answer, of course, is proof-of-work.",

But here too we are talking about people who grew up using money and now have to make do without it - exactly the situation &quot;imagined&quot; by the economics textbooks&quot; (p. 37 of Debt)<p>Further, the <i>second</i> place where Graeber notes that barter tends to emerges are precisely in those cases where different groups have no established societal relationships, and are thus exceptional to almost all well established societies - as exactly in a case like Columbus meeting natives:<p>&quot;True, barter does sometimes occur between people who do not consider each other strangers, but they&#x27;re usually people who might as well be strangers-that is, who feel no sense of mutual responsibility or trust, or the desire to develop ongoing relations. The Pukhtun of Northern Pakistan, for instance, are famous for their open-handed hospitality. Barter is what you do with those to whom you are <i>not</i> bound by ties of hospitality (or kinship, or much of anything else)&quot; (p.33).<p>Which is all to say that the two examples used above are very much exceptional, and exactly what one would expect if the anthropological understanding of debt holds.",

They definitely weren&#x27;t using IOUs.<p>there&#x27;s already very good rebuttal to David Graeber claims by Robert P. Murphy [1]: &quot;Finally, we have actual case studies of communities developing money prices from scratch: namely, prisoners who end up using cigarettes as the common medium of exchange.  The classic work here is Radford&#x27;s 1945 article, &quot;The Economic Organization of a P.O.W. Camp.&quot; There is nothing in Radford&#x27;s account that conflicts with the standard economists&#x27; story about the origin of money. The prisoners certainly weren&#x27;t giving each other things from their Red Cross kits as gifts or as loans. No, they first were trading (in a state of direct exchange) and cigarettes quickly became the money in their community for all of the reasons that economists typically cite.<p>And to reinforce the point we made earlier, Radford explains that the prices (quoted in cigarettes) of various items were posted on a board. If Graeber and his colleagues stumbled upon the ruins of this P.O.W. camp, they would presumably conclude that there was never a preexisting state of barter, because they only found boards listing prices quoted in terms of cigarettes. There were no boards listing the thousands of pairwise permutations of direct-exchange ratios, and so clearly the Mengerian story must have been wrong — so would go the erroneous reasoning of Graeber.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;have-anthropologists-overturned-menger\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;have-anthropologists-overturned-me...</a>",

If they were out of a job at the moment as well, but happened to have some extra money, would you expect them to provide you a loan so you could fund a start-up instead of getting a job?<p>I don&#x27;t believe human relationships and gift economies reduce to a kind of barter. There are barter-like aspects to it, but I think they stem from different internal impulses. I may well be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think we can assume they are not simply because some mutual exchange is taking place.",

        "text": "While this is a thought provoking article, it makes assumptions that are not necessarily true. If a person thinks in terms of resources and not in terms of products you can begin to see the fallacies. It is easy for a group with common interests to share resources. The problems begin to arise when the group doesn&#x27;t have a resource that it needs. As an example, if the Iroquois lived in a region where there was no obsidian which they would want for making tools and hunting instruments, they would need to approach a neighboring community that has access to the material If that community didn&#x27;t want the Iroquois to have that material because it would upset the balance of power in that this material could also be used for making weapons of war. If the other community already had all the resources it needed to comfortably survive, how would the Iroquois over come their reluctance to give them obsidian? For the Iroquois this is becoming a matter of survival of their people. It they don&#x27;t have this resource they won&#x27;t have the tools they need to farm or to hunt. This is just a simple example, with more complex societies the more complex the problems.\nIn my life time, I have seen people try to sustain &quot;gift economies&quot;. I remember the communes of the sixties. On paper they sounded quite reasonable. Most of them didn&#x27;t survive or evolved into capitalistic economies. \nOne last point. Slavery was not an out come of the invention of money. It was the out come of the invention  of war. What do you do with enemy combatants that surrender? Do you just kill them? Not if your humane. You make them slaves.",

It might be a software defect, or perhaps there is something capturing the text and trying to interpret it as a command. The issue is more difficult to reproduce if both the sender and recipient devices are iphone&#x27;s due to the default behavior of sending via iText.<p>I originally posted about this late last year [1]. I intend to investigate this issue more deeply, but my time has been consumed by another more pressing matter. The original HN post links to my blog post [2].

(This does not mean that evil actions are OK when democracies are guilty of them of course, I&#x27;m not saying that.)<p>If and when the day comes that China has had at least two transfers of power to new leaders as a result of internationally observed and validated democratic elections by the people of China, then it would be something to think about.

Go ahead and take issues with Trump, his policies, his words, his actions, I don&#x27;t care, but please do not pretend like just because Trump is president that magically the PRC and companies which are essentially controlled by its government are some kind of benign actors. Trump and has taken a hard-line against anything China since he ran in 2015, his anti-Huawei is very much in line with that stance. Also, Trump was pretty clear he wanted an American first economic policy, which makes it obvious he would be anti-expansion of any Chinese technological products.<p>TR;DL Trump being president has not a thing to do with whether or not Huawei and the PRC are attempting to infiltrate the network and data infrastructure of the world at large.",

There&#x27;s a 100% chance that any information they divulged will be acrimoniously parsed by the Chinese to determine the means by which the US obtained the information. The information will likely betray how the Americans are thinking about the problem as well. (Reference yesterday&#x27;s WaPo article on US&#x2F;Germany surveillance program and how it was compromised).<p>Second - there&#x27;s very limited upside in making the information public, are many downsides. The US, UK, and German agencies don&#x27;t care about you, or I or any other privacy advocate, or really the knowledge that might arise from a number of public voices piping in. This isn&#x27;t like open-source SSL software, where it makes sense from a security perspective to be open about it.<p>Also, I&#x27;m doubtful if the &#x27;evidence&#x27; the US presented is purely technical in nature. My guess is that this is not a situation of &quot;hey, look at this source code, on like 501, there you go, back door!&quot;, it&#x27;s probably much more complicated. If you read the article, you&#x27;ll indicate that the US has evidence that China is using its gear to surveil state actors, etc..<p>Revealing the &#x27;evidence&#x27; almost surely involves sensitive information regarding state officials from other countries, insight into US spy programs etc..<p>If the US is legitimately trying to convince UK&#x2F;Germany that Huawei gear is a legit threat, then providing them with the necessary information in confidence is obviously the rational thing to do.",
